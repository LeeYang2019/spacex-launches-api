# spacex-launches-api

This is a react-node application using apollo with graphql and spacex api. Users can browse the different missions that are returned from the spacex api, including details about those missions such as success and failures and the names and types of rockets that were about of the mission. Users can also see which missions are on the horizon in 2020.

Much thanks go to Brad Traversy for the tutorial on using graphql, which is completely different from rest. I certainly learned alot about creating schemas and executing queries in the graphql playground.
